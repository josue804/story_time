Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
  Needs a README. Commits are accurate but encompass too many changes.
Do all specs pass?
  4/6 passing specs.
Is there good spec coverage?
  Unit testing looks okay. You have no integration specs which is absolutely unacceptable, scrub, get good.
Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
  As clear as ryan h's backend whistle.
Is the site user-friendly?
  Pepe-gnarly. Seriously great site. Very intuitive.
Are there opportunities for refactoring?
  Code looks very clean, not much room for refactoring.
What features stand out?
  The ability for a user to check out their post history is pretty sweet.
What features could be improved?
  When a new story is created, it would be nice if the page redirected the user to add the first sentence to the story.
  The form to add a new sentence to the story could also be appended to the same page using an ajax call.
  It would be better to store pictures in their own model instead of locally, if the project ever went global.
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
  Nice job!
